              <p class="speaker-role">ACE Certified Personal Trainer, Owner of Aspire Fitness</p>
              <p class="speaker-line">Dedicated to helping others be physically and mentally healthy; part of The F.I.T. Lab community for over 10 years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="speaker-detail">
              <p>Michelle Dalluge is an ACE certified personal trainer who has dedicated her life to helping others be physically and mentally healthy. She has a bachelor’s in physical and health education, a master’s in Developmental Kinesiology, and is the owner of Aspire Fitness.</p>
              <p>Michelle does not just train her clients on how to be healthier and stronger—she also educates them that age is just a number. Being a 50+ mother of three who gained over 70 lbs with each pregnancy, she knows the struggles, especially for women who face taking care of their families along with everyday life. Her philosophy is that getting older does not mean it is too late to start your fitness journey. She educates her clients on how important strength training is as we get older and enjoys training or teaching classes to help them become stronger and feel empowered. She will push you beyond where you thought you would go and be right there with you to celebrate your successes. Her motto is “stronger than yesterday.” The first step is to walk through the door to start your fitness journey; once you have started, there is no looking back—no matter your age, gender, or fitness level, there is nothing that you can’t do.</p>
              <p>Aspire Fitness is not just about being healthy and stronger physically; it is also about making the community stronger. Michelle has volunteered in several community events to immerse herself in the great community that surrounds The Mali Center. Aspire Fitness hosted a family fun night where youth in the community were supplied with backpacks and school supplies to start the school year. Helping others, whether becoming physically stronger or making our community stronger, is what makes Michelle passionate in what she does.</p>
              <p>Michelle has been a part of The F.I.T. Lab community for over 10 years. She not only trains clients to become stronger through strength training but also practices what she teaches. Strength training and living a healthy lifestyle are part of who she is. Aspire Fitness currently offers personal training and a women’s cohort small group class for women who want to start or continue a strength training program, become healthier, and work with other women with similar goals.</p>
